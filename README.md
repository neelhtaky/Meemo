##Responsive Theme (Breakpoints)
Features five different breakpoings, which are easily referred to as "small", "medium", "large", "xlarge" and "xxlarge".
Each breakpoint has been designed to work nicely with different sized devices:
1. The small breakpoint works well with mobiles.
2. The medium breakpoint works well with tablet devices (such as iPads), or e-readers like the Kindle, or netbooks.
3. The large breakpoint works well with laptops. Tested for laptops up to 15" screen sizes.
4. The xxlarge breakpoint works well with larger laptops, such as above 17" screen sizes. It also works great with smaller desktop screens (typical with older computers).
5. The xxlarge breakpoint is designed to work with wide screen desktops.
##Navigation
###Main Navigation
The theme consists of complex navigation code, that is designed to work fluidly with different sized devices.
For example, the small breakpoint consists of a singular navigation found at the top of the page. It is a mobile (touch) enabled navigation that will slide out from the left with menu links when pressed. This navigation can handle drop down menus.
Medium breakpoint features a different styled header navigation, that is designed to contain a certain number of links. This navigation can handle drop down menus.
For large, and above, breakpoints a secondary navigation menu is enabled as a "left sidebar". This sidebar *cannot* support drop downs. The header navigation is by default hidden for large and above.
